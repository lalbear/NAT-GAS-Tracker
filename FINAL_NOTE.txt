IMPORTANT: Excel vs. Google Sheets

1. You mentioned extracting data from your "Copy of Nat Gas ETFs... .xlsx" file.
2. The automation works with **Google Sheets**.
3. **Action**:
   - Upload your `.xlsx` file to Google Drive.
   - **Double-click** it to open. It might open in "Office Compatibility Mode".
   - Click **File > Save as Google Sheets**.
   - Use the **ID** of this new Google Sheet for the automation.
   
The script will then update this **Google Sheet** exactly as you expect.
(It cannot directly edit a raw .xlsx file sitting in Drive without converting it first).
